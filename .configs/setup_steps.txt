loosely following this with kitty instead of iterm2:
https://www.josean.com/posts/terminal-setup

Install Homebrew
Install kitty
	~/.config/kitty included in ~/.configs repo
Clone ~/.configs repo
	clone kitty-smart-tab submodule
Install oh-my-zsh & p10k
	install optional plugins by cloning, not with brew:
		git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
		git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
brew install:
	ack, tldr, tree
	(check install in /usr/local/bin)

NVIM
Install neovim via brew or MacPorts
Clone ~/.config/nvim kickstart repo (custom branch)
If pyright fails to install, install node.js (via brew or nvm)
Install ripgrep (telescope dependency) - may use this instead of ack?
